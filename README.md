Simple LAN Network – Packet Tracer Lab


📌 Overview


This is a simple LAN topology built using Cisco Packet Tracer.

The goal of this lab is to practice:

    Basic LAN setup

    Connecting end devices to a switch

    Assigning IP addresses

    Testing connectivity using ping

📐 Topology


Devices included:

    1 × Switch

    4 × PCs (PC0, PC1, PC2, PC3)

    All devices connected with Copper Straight-Through cables
🧪 Connectivity Tests


Using ping, all devices were able to reach each other successfully.


Example from PC0:

Ping 192.168.1.11 → Success
Ping 192.168.1.12 → Success
Ping 192.168.1.13 → Success
Ping 192.168.1.10 → Success
